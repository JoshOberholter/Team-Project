This is Phase 2 of our Team Project

For this phase, we unfortunately were not able to impliment full functionality of the communication between the Client and Server, as our Client was not fully fleshed out. Our plans for the future are to allow the Client to create a new user, where right now it can not, and then be able to perform multiple actions. Those actions would correspond to the methods found in the Server class.

Joshua - Sumbitted Phase 2 to Vocaruem Workspace

Server - This is the server, which will connect to a Client and communicate with it, performing specific functions. It has the capacity to accept multiple clients at once, using the ClientHandler class that will hold each thread. The run method holds the functionality for each thread, where we show the srver and client will communicate. For now we have not fully fleshed out the login and user creation component, but after that we will have the client show a page giving the options of actiosn they can take, which will then be went to the server and put into a switch statement, which will call the corresponding method that we see in ClientHandler subclass, which are sendFriendRequest, remove Friend, respondFriendRequest, blocked, startGroupchat, deleteGroupchat, addMessage, deleteMessage, parseMessage, and parseGroupchat.

Client - This is the client which will connect to the Server and communicate with it. It will not store any information, rather it prompt input from the user and display information sent by the serve when those things are necessary. For now, the Client is not completely finished and only has the functionality to login to a user. In the future we will impliment a create new user function, adn then allow the user to select the actions the Server supplies them.

Database.java - This is the database of our social media application. It contains ArrayLists of both the the users that have accessed the database as well as the groupchats that are a part of it. It can be initilized with or without a preexisting list of participants and groupchats. It contains getters for its ArrayLists, participants and groupChats, as well as methods to both add and remove from them. It also contains methods to read and write to a database text file that allows the context of the database to be stored. it is also thread safe, so it can be accessed by multiple threads at once.

GroupChat.java - This is where direct messaging takes place in our social media application. It contains an ArrayList of users that holds the members of the groupchat and an ArrayList of Messages that holds the chat's messages. It is initalized by calling the constructor with an Arraylist of the members you want in the chat. It has getters for the members and messages, as well as methods to add and remove both members and messages. It also has a method to return all of the photopaths from messages that contain them, as well as an overwritten toString method.

Message.java - This is the message object for our social media application. It can be initialized with a User and a message, or a user, message, and photo path for sharing pictures. It also holds the boolean value seen, which will be set to false. It contains getters and setters for all of its fields, as well as an overwritten equals and toString methods

User.java - This is the user object for out social media application. It is initialized with a username, password, and a boolean of whether you want strangers to be able to message you or not. The password is checked to see if it follows our requirements before it is initialized, and if it doesnt, the constructor throws an Invalid Password Exception. The other fields are the friends, freindRequests, blockedUsers, and dmsAnd GroupChats ArrayLists as well the string for a profile picture path. It contains getters and setters for many of the fields, a , methods that return whether or not a user is in the friends of blocked ArrayLists, methods to add or remove users from the blockedUsers list and groupChats from the dmsAndGroupChats list. It also contains functionality for sending, accepting, and denying friend requests. There are methods to add and remove messages from a groupchat using the specific user, and finally there is an overwritten equals method and an overwritten toString method.

PhotoUploader.java - This file will be how we upload photos to messages and user profiles pictures down the line, using GUI to let the user upload pictures.

UserProfileUI.java - This file will be how we display a users profile down the line, using GUI to display their information as well as their profile picture

Exceptions: InvalidPasswordException - will be thrown when a password does not meet the requirements when trying to create a new user MessageNotFoundException - Will be thrown when trying to remove a message and it is not in the ArrayList UserNotFoundException - Will be thrown when trying to remove a User and it is not in the ArrayList

Interfaces: DatabaseInt.java - Interface for Database GroupChatInt.java - Interface for GroupChat MessageInt.java - Interface for Message UserInt.java - Interface for User UserProfileInt - Interface for UserProfileUI
